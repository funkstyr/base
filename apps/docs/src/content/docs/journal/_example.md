## Goals

* [ ] Finalize API endpoint for user authentication.
* [ ] Implement frontend login form and basic validation.
* [ ] Write unit tests for the new authentication service.
* [ ] Begin research on two-factor authentication (2FA) integration.
* [ ] Address critical bug #123 related to session management.

---

## Accomplishments / Tasks Completed

* **API Development:**
    * [x] Designed and implemented the `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` API endpoints. (Jira-TICKET-456)
    * [x] Added password hashing using bcrypt.
    * [x] Successfully tested endpoints with Postman, all core scenarios passing.
* **Bug Fixes:**
    * [x] Investigated and resolved critical bug #123: Users were intermittently losing session data. Root cause was improper cookie expiration setting. (GitHub Issue #123)
* **Documentation:**
    * [x] Drafted initial API documentation for the new authentication endpoints.

## In Progress

* **Frontend Development:**
    * `login-form-component`: Started building the React component for the login form. HTML structure is complete. (Branch: `feature/login-form`)
    * Basic client-side validation (email format, password length) is partially implemented.
* **Testing:**
    * Outlined test cases for the `AuthService`. Implementation to start next.

## Blockers & Challenges

* **Challenge:** Initial difficulty in configuring the OAuth 2.0 library with our existing user database schema.
    * **Resolution:** Spent ~3 hours consulting documentation and experimenting. Found a configuration workaround that seems stable. Will monitor.
* **Blocker (Resolved):** CI/CD pipeline was failing due to an outdated dependency.
    * **Resolution:** Collaborated with DevOps to update the `our-custom-linter` package. Pipeline is now green. (Slack Thread: [Link to Slack conversation])
* **Waiting For:**
    * Feedback from @UX_Team on the proposed 2FA user flow diagram. (Sent on YYYY-MM-DD)

---

## Learnings & Insights

* **Technical:**
    * Learned more about the intricacies of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) lifetimes and refresh token strategies.
    * Discovered a useful VS Code extension `PrettyAPI` for formatting API request/response logs.
* **Process:**
    * Pair programming with @AnotherDev on the bug fix for #123 was highly effective and sped up resolution.
    * Reminder to allocate more explicit time for writing documentation alongside feature development, rather than as an afterthought.

---

## Next Plans

* [ ] Complete frontend login form implementation and validation.
* [ ] Implement unit tests for `AuthService` (Target: 80% coverage).
* [ ] Begin implementation of user registration flow (frontend and backend).
* [ ] Follow up on 2FA research and create a small proof-of-concept if UX feedback is positive.
* [ ] Review and merge PR for `feature/auth-endpoints`.
* [ ] Attend sprint planning meeting.

## Overall Mood/Notes (Optional)

* Felt productive this week, especially after resolving the session bug. The API work went smoother than anticipated.
* A bit concerned about the tight deadline for the 2FA feature, pending research.
